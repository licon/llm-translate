# Privacy Policy for LLM-Translate

**Last Updated:** July 23, 2025

Thank you for using LLM-Translate. Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains what information the extension handles and why.

### Our Commitment

We do not have a server, and we do not collect or store any of your personal information. All data processing happens either locally on your computer or between your browser and the third-party translation service you choose to use.

### Information Handled by the Extension

To provide its features, the extension handles the following data:

1.  **API Keys (Authentication Information):**
    *   You provide an API key for a third-party Large Language Model (LLM) service (e.g., Google Gemini, Silicon Flow).
    *   **How it's used:** This key is required to authenticate your requests with the service provider.
    *   **How it's stored:** The key is saved exclusively on your local device using the `chrome.storage` API. It is never sent to us or any other service besides the one you configured.

2.  **Text for Translation (Website Content & User Activity):**
    *   This is the text you either highlight on a webpage or type into the extension's popup window.
    *   **How it's used:** This text is sent directly to the third-party LLM service you have configured for the sole purpose of translation.
    *   **How it's stored:** This text is not stored by the extension. It is used only for the immediate translation request.

### Third-Party Services

When you use the extension, the text you translate and your API key are sent to the third-party service you have selected. Your data becomes subject to their privacy policies. We encourage you to review them:

*   **Google Gemini:** [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
*   **Silicon Flow:** [Privacy Policy](https://docs.siliconflow.cn/en/legals/privacy-policy)

### Data Security

We use the standard `chrome.storage.local` API provided by the browser to store your API key securely on your machine.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy in the future. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page.
